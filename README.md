# Project-Astronomy 

We created a model capable of predicting the number and the size of halos which appear in the future. The Ann.py consists of the final code and the remaining were experiments which we ran on the simulation created by gadget2.

## Run

Clone the repository.
To run the model, you need to execute the following command:
```
python3 Ann.py
```
## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- keras : <code> pip install keras </code>
- numpy : <code> pip install numpy </code>
- sklearn : <code> pip install sklearn </code>

## System Used
1. CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz
2. GPU: 1xTesla K80 , having 2496 CUDA cores, compute 3.7,  12GB(11.439GB Usable) GDDR5  VRAM
3. RAM: 12.6GB
